<h3 align="center">One place for what every site shares</h3>
<p align="center">Check, release and deploy actions, linter and Playwright configs, the author credit, the theme peek and Yandex Metrika</p>

Shared CI, linter and e2e configs for the aimuzov-projects sites built from [infra-site-template](https://github.com/aimuzov-projects/infra-site-template). A fix to the checks, the deploy or the code style lands here once instead of in every site.

## What's inside

- [**Actions**](#actions) `check`, `release` and `deploy`: the steps of the site workflows, from `npm ci` to the deploy over SSH.
- [**Configs**](#configs) of Prettier, Stylelint (BEM included) and oxlint, with their plugins.
- [**Author credit**](#author-credit): the shared footer line for Astro and Svelte.
- [**Theme**](#theme): the theme switch logic and the script that applies the choice before the first paint.
- [**Theme peek**](#theme-peek): a theme button that shows the other scheme in a circle around itself.
- [**Base styles**](#base-styles): the root defaults, a steady scrollbar gutter and no tap highlight.
- [**Yandex Metrika**](#yandex-metrika) that loads after the first interaction and brings its own CSP sources.
- [**Not-found page**](#not-found-page) with the author's face and suggestions from the sitemap.
- [**Reader changelog**](#reader-changelog): the "Что нового" page, its format and the release PR check.
- [**E2E tests**](#e2e-tests): the Playwright preset and the checks every site shares.
- [**Renovate**](#renovate): the update preset of the sites.

## Actions

- [`check`](check/action.yml): `npm ci`, then Prettier, oxlint, stylelint, `astro check` and `svelte-check`, `node --test`, the build and the reader changelog check. Packages from Ubuntu go in `apt-packages`.
- [`release`](release/action.yml): [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) keeps the release PR up to date with the changelog from conventional commits; merging it cuts a tag and a GitHub release, the action then outputs `created` and `tag`. The release PR comes from `github-actions[bot]`, so GitHub holds its `pull_request` runs for approval; the action approves them, otherwise the required check would never come.
- [`deploy`](deploy/action.yml): SSH to the projects server, where the key runs `deploy/site.sh` of infra-server for the site, then waits for `url` to answer. `ref` is the release tag to deploy, empty deploys the newest `main`. The server address and its `known_hosts` line live here.

They are composite actions, not reusable workflows: the job stays in the site, so the required `check` status keeps its name, and a site adds its own steps before or after.

## Usage

`.github/workflows/check.yml`:

```yaml
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/check@v2
```

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, a deploy by release:

```yaml
jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      actions: write
    outputs:
      created: ${{ steps.release.outputs.created }}
      tag: ${{ steps.release.outputs.tag }}
    steps:
      - id: release
        uses: aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/release@v2

  check:
    needs: release
    if: needs.release.outputs.created == 'true'
    uses: ./.github/workflows/check.yml

  deploy:
    needs: [release, check]
    if: >-
      always() && vars.DEPLOY_ENABLED == 'true' &&
      (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || needs.check.result == 'success')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://example.com
    steps:
      - uses: aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/deploy@v2
        with:
          ssh-key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
          url: https://example.com/
          ref: ${{ needs.release.outputs.tag || inputs.tag }}
```

release-please reads `release-please-config.json` (`"release-type": "node"`, `"packages": { ".": {} }`) and `.release-please-manifest.json` with the current version (`{ ".": "1.0.0" }`). The repo needs "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" in its Actions settings.

## Configs

The repo is also an npm package with the Prettier, Stylelint (BEM included) and oxlint configs. Their plugins are dependencies of the package; Prettier, Stylelint and oxlint stay in the site, so their binaries are there.

```bash
npm install -D github:aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit#v2.0.0
```

- `.prettierrc.json`: `"@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/prettier"`
- `stylelint.config.mjs`: `export default { extends: ['@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/stylelint'] }`, the site's own `overrides` go next to `extends`
- `.oxlintrc.json`: `{ "extends": ["./node_modules/@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/oxlint.json"] }`

The oxlint config wants blank lines before `return` and `throw`, around blocks (`if`, loops, `try`, `switch`), after `const`/`let` groups and around multiline expressions. `oxlint --fix` puts them in; Prettier only keeps them, so the site runs `oxlint --fix` before `prettier --write`.

npm takes the package as a tarball from GitHub, so the build image needs no git.

## Author credit

The credit line every site shares: "2026 © Сделано с любовью [mark] aimuzov" and, when `repo` is given, an "Исходный код" link with the GitHub mark. The mark is a face with a mustache drawn as one evenodd path with no masks or ids, so a page may hold any number of copies.

- `credit.astro` is for static pages: the same markup plus a script that sets the year by the visitor's clock. Without it the build year stays until the next deploy. Astro inlines the script and puts its hash into the CSP with the rest.
- `credit.svelte` is for Svelte apps, where the year is computed in the browser anyway.
- `year.js` is `syncYear()` itself: it fills every `data-year` element, for a site that has its own.

```astro
---
import Credit from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/credit.astro'
---

<Credit repo="https://github.com/aimuzov-projects/example" />
```

By default the credit stretches over the container: the author on the left, "Исходный код" on the right. `align="center"` keeps both parts in the middle.

With a mouse only the face peeks out at first, and the line slides up from below on hover or keyboard focus. Touch screens have no hover, so they show the whole line right away.

`copyright={false}` drops the year when the site has its own © line. `--credit-hover` sets the link hover color; everything else is inherited from the footer.

## Theme

The theme switch logic without markup; the site draws the button and the labels. The choice lives on `<html data-theme="light|dark">` and in localStorage; without the attribute `prefers-color-scheme` leads, so the site CSS sets `color-scheme` by the attribute and `light dark` without it.

A click always flips the visible scheme, just like the [peek](#theme-peek) circle. When the new scheme matches the system one, the choice is forgotten and the site follows the system again.

`theme-boot.astro` in `<head>` applies the choice before the first paint, so the page does not flash the system theme. It is a same-origin file rather than an inline script, so the Astro CSP lets it through by `'self'` without hashes. `key` is the localStorage key, `theme` by default.

```astro
---
import ThemeBoot from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/theme-boot.astro'
---

<head>
	<ThemeBoot key="site:theme" />
</head>
```

```svelte
<script>
	import { toggleTheme, watchTheme } from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/theme.js'

	let theme = $state('auto')

	$effect(() => watchTheme((next) => (theme = next)))
</script>

<button onclick={() => toggleTheme({ key: 'site:theme' })}>…</button>
```

- `toggleTheme(options)`: a click; flips the scheme and returns the new theme.
- `applyTheme(theme, options)`: set `auto`, `light` or `dark` directly, say from a menu with a button per theme.
- `nextTheme(theme, system)`: the theme a click will give, for the button label before the click.
- `currentTheme()`, `systemScheme()`, `schemeOf(theme, system)`: what is chosen, what the system has and what is visible.
- `watchTheme(callback)`: watches both the system and the attribute, so a second switch on the page hears about the click too. Calls back right away; returns the unsubscribe.

## Theme peek

A theme button that shows what it switches to. The closer the pointer gets to the button, the wider a faint circle grows around it; on hover the circle opens to a third of the screen, and inside it the page is drawn in the other scheme. A click puts the circle out until the next hover. Touch screens and reduced motion get no circle.

The circle holds a copy of the page painted in the other scheme: `color-scheme` on the copy flips the `light-dark()` colors, and the `light`/`dark` class is for a site that switches its tokens by a class. Such a site declares its light tokens on `:root, .light` as well, or the copy inside a dark page keeps the dark ones. Rules like `.dark .input` would still reach into a light copy, so they take `:not(.dark .light *)`. The current scheme is read from the root `color-scheme`, so it does not matter whether the choice lives in an attribute or a class.

```svelte
<script>
	import '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/theme-peek.css'
	import { themePeek } from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/theme-peek.js'
</script>

<button onclick={cycle} {@attach themePeek}>…</button>
```

The copy takes the place of `<body>`, so the site adds `.theme-peek` to its body rule for the layout and background: `body, .theme-peek { … }`.

By default the circle shows the scheme opposite to the current one. A switch with a button per theme passes its own: `{@attach (node) => themePeek(node, { target: () => 'dark' })}`. When the target matches the current scheme there is nothing to show and the circle stays hidden. Of several buttons side by side, only the one nearest the pointer draws the circle, and a click on any of them puts it out for all.

A button with other controls right next to it passes `{ approach: false }`: the faint circle no longer grows as the pointer nears, so hovering a neighbour leaves the page alone, and the circle opens only on hover of the button itself.

## Base styles

`base.css` holds the root defaults every site shares:

- **Scrollbar gutter.** A page that scrolls is narrower than one that does not by the width of the window scrollbar, so on the way between them the header and everything pinned to the right edge jump sideways. The root reserves the gutter on every page (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`); with scrollbars drawn over the content (macOS, phones) it changes nothing. Layers with `position: fixed` are laid out by the window and reach under the gutter, so a site that lines one up with the page measures `document.body`, not `innerWidth`.
- **No tap highlight.** On touch, WebKit fills the tapped link or button with a grey square box that follows neither the shape of the element nor the style of the site. The root turns it off (`-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`); the property inherits, so buttons and links are left with their own feedback on press.

```astro
---
import '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/base.css'
---
```

The site imports it once, in the base layout. A new shared root rule lands here, so a site picks it up with the kit update alone.

## Yandex Metrika

The counter loads `tag.js` on the first interaction or 4 s after `load`, so the ~85 KB script doesn't steal bandwidth from fonts and the first photo; earlier `ym` calls wait in a queue. Webvisor is off: on mobile it raises LCP.

- `metrika.astro` goes into `<head>`. It renders the snippet inline and puts its hash, `mc.yandex.ru` and `yastatic.net` into the page CSP through `Astro.csp`, merged with the site's directives. From `<body>` it would be too late: Astro writes the CSP `<meta>` right after the head content. `init` overrides the init options, e.g. `{ webvisor: true }`.
- `metrika-pixel.astro` is the `<noscript>` pixel for visitors without JavaScript. It goes into `<body>`, since an image isn't allowed in `<noscript>` inside `<head>`.

```astro
---
import Metrika from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/metrika.astro'
import MetrikaPixel from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/metrika-pixel.astro'
---

<head>
	<Metrika id={12345678} />
</head>
<body>
	<MetrikaPixel id={12345678} />
</body>
```

The site's `security.csp` keeps no Yandex sources: the component brings them only to pages that have it.

## Not-found page

The 404 every site shares: a big "4 [face] 4" with the author's face in place of the zero (it wiggles its mustache, like in the credit), a heading, a line of text, "На главную" and "Назад", and "Возможно, вы искали" with the pages closest to the missing address.

- The suggestions come from the sitemap: a typo in the address (`/extra` → `/extras`, case, the trailing slash and `.html` don't count) or the nearest parent page (`/blog/post/old` → `/blog/post/`). Until they load, or when nothing fits, the block stays hidden.
- "Назад" shows only when the visitor came from the same site, otherwise it would take them away from it.
- The site keeps its own wrapper: `Base` with `index={false}`, the header, the footer and the height of `<main>`.

```astro
---
import NotFound from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/not-found.astro'
import Base from '#frontend/layouts/base.astro'
---

<Base title="Страница не найдена" index={false}>
	<main class="missing">
		<NotFound>
			<a slot="actions" class="not-found__action" href="/#contacts">Контакты</a>
		</NotFound>
	</main>
</Base>
```

- Props: `title`, `text`, `home={{ href, label }}`, `back` (`false` drops the button), `suggest` (`false` drops the suggestions and the sitemap request), `sitemap` (the index path, `/sitemap-index.xml` by default), `scope` and `exclude` (path prefixes: a bilingual site gives each language its own 404, `scope="/ru/"` on the Russian one and `exclude={['/ru/']}` on the English one, so each suggests only its own pages). The defaults are in Russian.
- The default slot goes under the text (a second language, a contact line); the `actions` slot goes after the buttons, and the `not-found__action` class gives a link the same look.
- The site theme comes through custom properties: `--not-found-accent` (the face, the main button and the links; `currentColor` by default), `--not-found-muted`, `--not-found-radius`, `--not-found-gap`. The font and the background are inherited.
- `not-found.js` is the same logic without markup: `suggestPaths(path, paths)`, `canGoBack()` and `notFound(root)`; `sitemap.js` reads the sitemap in the browser, `mark.js` is the face path.

## Reader changelog

The "Что нового" page: what changed on the site in the reader's words, next to the technical `CHANGELOG.md` of release-please. Each release gets an entry, and the release PR stays red until it does.

- A site opts in with the `changelog` field of its `package.json`: `true` (the file is `src/frontend/data/changelog.json`), a path, or `{ "file", "guide", "icons" }`. `guide` is a Markdown file with the site's audience and voice (`changelog.guide.md` by default), `icons` are the names of the site's own icons next to the lucide-static ones.
- An entry is `{ "version", "date", "title", "icon", "items" }`, newest first; a link inside an item is `[text](/path/)`. A release with nothing the reader would notice gets `{ "version", "hidden": true }`: it ships, the page skips it.
- The `check` action runs `site-changelog verify` after the build: the format, an entry for the version in `package.json` (release-please bumps it in the release PR) and every link leading to a page in `dist`.
- `site-changelog context` prints what an entry is written from: the guide, the `CHANGELOG.md` section, the PR descriptions (via `gh`), the diff since the last tag, the pages of the build and the recent entries. `site-changelog add entry.json` puts the entry on top, verifies the file and formats it with the site's Prettier.

```astro
---
import Changelog from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/changelog.astro'
import * as lucide from 'lucide-static'
import releases from '#frontend/data/changelog.json'
import Base from '#frontend/layouts/base.astro'
---

<Base title="Что нового">
	<main>
		<Changelog {releases} icons={lucide} lead="Что изменилось, простыми словами." />
	</main>
</Base>
```

- Props: `releases`, `icons` (SVG by icon name), `title` (`false` when the site draws its own `<h1>`), `lead`, `toc` (the table of contents label, `false` drops it), `versionLabel`, `locale`. The `hero` slot goes under the lead.
- The site theme comes through custom properties: `--changelog-accent`, `--changelog-muted`, `--changelog-width`, `--changelog-padding`, `--changelog-sticky-top`.
- `changelog.js` is the same logic without markup, for a site with its own page: `itemHtml`, `releaseDate`, `releaseId`, `visibleReleases` and `releaseErrors`.

## E2E tests

The Playwright preset and the checks every site shares. Unit tests stay on `node --test`; Playwright is for what needs a real browser: the built pages, the CSP, the theme and the counter.

`@playwright/test` stays in the site, so its binary and the browser are there; `@axe-core/playwright` comes with the kit.

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
```

`playwright.config.ts`:

```ts
export { default } from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/playwright'
```

The preset runs `e2e/` in Chromium against the production build: `astro build && astro preview` on port 4399 (`E2E_PORT` moves it), a fresh build every run. A site extends it with `defineConfig(preset, { … })`; a server of its own there, such as the API, is started next to the preview.

`e2e/site.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { siteChecks } from '@aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit/playwright/checks'

siteChecks({
	theme: { button: (page) => page.getByRole('button', { name: /^Тема:/ }) },
	metrika: true,
})
```

- Every page of `sitemap-index.xml` answers 200 and logs no errors to the console: exceptions, failed requests and CSP violations included. `ignoreConsole` lets known messages through.
- axe checks every sitemap page against WCAG 2.1 AA in both schemes. `a11y: { disableRules, exclude }` narrows it, `a11y: false` turns it off.
- With `theme`: clicking the button changes the root `color-scheme` and the choice survives a reload (`persist: false` when it should not), and hovering it opens the theme peek, which a click puts out (`peek: false` for a button without one).
- Every sitemap page reserves the scrollbar gutter and all of them are equally wide, whether they scroll or not (see [Base styles](#base-styles)). Headless Chromium hides scrollbars, so the check launches its own browser with the classic ones. A site without a sitemap lists its pages in `gutter: { paths }`, and `gutter: false` turns the check off.
- Every sitemap page turns the tap highlight off (see [Base styles](#base-styles)). `tapHighlight: { paths }` and `tapHighlight: false` work as with `gutter`.
- With `metrika`: the page has the counter, but `tag.js` is not requested before the first interaction. Yandex itself is never reached.
- With `notFound`: a missing address answers 404 with `noindex`, a link home and a working "Назад", passes axe in both schemes, and a typo in a sitemap address is suggested (`suggest: false` for a site without suggestions, `exclude` as on the component). `path` and `home` move the probe and the home link.

The same checks are exported one by one (`expectHealthyPage`, `expectAccessible`, `expectStableWidth`, `expectNoTapHighlight`, `expectThemeToggle`, `expectThemePeek`, `expectMetrikaDeferred`, `expectNotFound`, `expectNotFoundSuggests`, `sitemapPaths`) for a site's own tests.

In CI the job of `.github/workflows/check.yml` runs them after the `check` action, with the browser cached by the Playwright version, see [infra-site-template](https://github.com/aimuzov-projects/infra-site-template).

## Renovate

[`default.json`](default.json) is the Renovate preset of the sites: weekly grouped updates (Astro and Svelte, tooling, Node, GitHub Actions), a 3-day wait after a release. A merge into `main` doesn't deploy, a release does, so non-major updates merge themselves once the checks pass, and what ends up in production (`dependencies`, base images, Node) is committed as `fix(deps)`, which makes release-please cut a release for it. A site turns it on with `renovate.json`:

```json
{ "extends": ["github>aimuzov-projects/infra-site-kit"] }
```

## Development

Node comes from `engines` in [`package.json`](package.json). The same checks as in CI ([`check.yml`](.github/workflows/check.yml)):

```bash
npm ci
npm run format:check && npm test
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

- Unit tests (`node --test`) run the configs against [`test/site`](test/site), which takes them by the package name the way a site does, and cover the credit year, the Metrika snippet, the theme peek math, the theme switch and the boot script.
- The kit has no Astro site, so e2e runs the shared checks against a two-page stand-in from [`test/e2e/server.mjs`](test/e2e/server.mjs): a sitemap with the production domain, a theme button with the peek and the deferred Metrika.

## Versions

Sites pin the actions to the major tag `v2` and the package to an exact tag such as `v2.0.0`. A compatible change gets a `v2.x.y` tag and moves `v2` to it; a breaking one starts `v3`.

```bash
git tag v2.0.1 && git tag -f v2 && git push origin v2.0.1 && git push -f origin v2
```

The version in `package.json` goes up in a `chore: release 2.x.y` commit before the tag. Sites then move the package pin to the new tag.
